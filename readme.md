## Introduction


Folder "Data" contains training and testing files
There is one data preprocessing file ("textprep.py")

We have two baseline models within folders " Baseline_tfidf" and "Basline_word2vec"

1) In folder "Baseline_tfidf"  you will find 'tfidf_train.py' and 'tfidf_test.py' for training and testing the model respectively and command to train is
 "python tfidf_train.py"
and to test already trained saved model run
" python tfidf_test.py"
You will also find output file here named "testing_output_testidf.csv"

2) In folder "Basline_word2vec"  you will find  'word2vec_train.py' and 'word2vec_test.py' for training and testing the model respectively and command to train is
 "python word2vec_train.py"
and to test already trained saved model run
" python word2vec_test.py"
You will also find output file here named "testing_output_word2vec.csv"

3) In folder "Propesed_elmo"  you will find  'elmo_train.py' and 'elmo_test.py' for training and testing the model respectively and command to train is
 "python elmo_train.py"
and to test already trained saved model run
" python elmo_test.py"
You will also find output file here named "testing_output_elmo.csv"
